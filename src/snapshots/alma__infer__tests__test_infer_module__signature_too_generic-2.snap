Input:

module Test exposing (main)

type List a = List a

main : List a
main = List 1

Output:

The type signature is more general than the inferred type:

  3│  type List a = List a
  4│  
  5│  main : List a
   │  ↑↑↑↑
  6│  main = List 1

The type signature says the type is

List a

which it is more general than

List Float

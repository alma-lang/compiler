Output:

Test.alma [6:9]

Type mismatch:  Option Float  ≠  Float

Expected

  4│  
  5│  test = when Some (Some 1) is
  6│      Some a | Some (Some a) -> a
   │           ↑

with type

    Option Float

to have the same type as

  4│  
  5│  test = when Some (Some 1) is
  6│      Some a | Some (Some a) -> a
   │                          ↑

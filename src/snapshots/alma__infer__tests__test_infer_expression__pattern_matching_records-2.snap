Output:

Test.alma [4:4]

Type mismatch:  { a | x : b }  ≠  Float

Expected

  2│  
  3│  test = when 5 is
  4│      {x} -> x
   │      ↑↑↑

with type

    { a | x : b }

to have the same type as

  1│  module Test exposing (test)
  2│  
  3│  test = when 5 is
   │              ↑
  4│      {x} -> x

with type

    Float

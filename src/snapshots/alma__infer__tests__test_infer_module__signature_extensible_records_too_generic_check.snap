Input:

module Test exposing (main)

main : { r | x : a, y: a } -> Float
main r = r.x + r.y + 1

Output:

[3:0]

The type signature is more generic than the inferred type:

  1│  module Test exposing (main)
  2│  
  3│  main : { r | x : a, y: a } -> Float
   │  ↑↑↑↑
  4│  main r = r.x + r.y + 1

The type signature says the type is

{ a | x : b, y : b } -> Float

which it is more general than

{ a | x : Float, y : Float } -> Float

which was inferred from the code.

Change the signature to be more specific or try to make your code more generic.

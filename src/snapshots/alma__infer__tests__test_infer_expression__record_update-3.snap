expression: "infer(\"{ { age = 5 } | age = \\\"Hi\\\" }\")"

Input:

{ { age = 5 } | age = "Hi" }

Output:

[1:2]

Type mismatch:  { age : Float }  ≠  { a | age : String }

Expected

  1│  { { age = 5 } | age = "Hi" }
   │    ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑

to be

{ a | age : String }

but seems to be

{ age : Float }

Input:

module Test exposing (main)

type Fruit a = Banana (a -> a -> a)

main = Banana 1

Output:

Test.alma [5:14]

Type mismatch:  Float  ≠  a -> a -> a

Expected

  3│  type Fruit a = Banana (a -> a -> a)
  4│  
  5│  main = Banana 1
   │                ↑

to be

a -> a -> a

but seems to be

Float

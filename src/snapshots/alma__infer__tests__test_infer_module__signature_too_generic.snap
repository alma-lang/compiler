Input:

module Test exposing (main)

main : a
main = 5

Output:

Test.alma [3:0]

The type signature is more generic than the inferred type:

  1│  module Test exposing (main)
  2│  
  3│  main : a
   │  ↑↑↑↑
  4│  main = 5

The type signature says the type is

a

which it is more general than

Float

which was inferred from the code.

Change the signature to be more specific or try to make your code more generic.

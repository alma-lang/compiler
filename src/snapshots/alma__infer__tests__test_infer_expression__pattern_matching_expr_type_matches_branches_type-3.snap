Output:

Test.alma [4:4]

Type mismatch:  Bool  ≠  { x : Float }

Expected

  2│  
  3│  test = when {x = 1} is
  4│      True -> True
   │      ↑↑↑↑
  5│              

with type

    Bool

to have the same type as

  1│  module Test exposing (test)
  2│  
  3│  test = when {x = 1} is
   │              ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑
  4│      True -> True
  5│              

with type

    { x : Float }

Output:

Test.alma [5:4]

Type mismatch:  Float  ≠  Bool

Expected

  3│  test = when 5 is
  4│      1 -> True
  5│      1.2 -> 2
   │      ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑
  6│              

with type

Float

to have the same type as

  2│  
  3│  test = when 5 is
  4│      1 -> True
   │      ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑
  5│      1.2 -> 2
  6│              

with type

Test.alma [4:4]

Patterns introduce different bindings:

Expected

  2│  
  3│  test = when 1 is
  4│      a | 2 as b | 3 as c -> True
   │      ↑
  5│              

which introduces

    a

to introduce the same bindings as

  2│  
  3│  test = when 1 is
  4│      a | 2 as b | 3 as c -> True
   │          ↑↑↑↑↑↑
  5│              

which introduces

    b

Output:

Test.alma [5:12]

Type mismatch:  Bool  ≠  Float

Expected

  3│  test = let
  4│      f x = when x is
  5│          1 | False | 3 -> True
   │              ↑↑↑↑↑
  6│          _ -> False
  7│  f 5

with type

    Bool

to have the same type as

  3│  test = let
  4│      f x = when x is
  5│          1 | False | 3 -> True
   │          ↑
  6│          _ -> False
  7│  f 5

with type

    Float

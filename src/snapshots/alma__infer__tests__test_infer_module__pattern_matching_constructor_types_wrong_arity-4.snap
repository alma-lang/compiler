Input:

module Test exposing (test)

type Test a = X a | Y

test = when X 1 is
    Y a -> a

Output:

Test.alma [6:4]

Type mismatch:  Test Float -> Test Float  ≠  Test a

Expected

  4│  
  5│  test = when X 1 is
  6│      Y a -> a
   │      ↑

to be

Test a

but seems to be

Test Float -> Test Float

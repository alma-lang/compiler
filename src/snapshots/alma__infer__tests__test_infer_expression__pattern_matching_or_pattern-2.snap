Output:

Test.alma [4:8]

Type mismatch:  Bool  ≠  Float

Expected

  2│  
  3│  test = when 5 is
  4│      1 | False | 3 -> True
   │          ↑↑↑↑↑
  5│      _ -> False
  6│              

with type

    Bool

to have the same type as

  2│  
  3│  test = when 5 is
  4│      1 | False | 3 -> True
   │      ↑
  5│      _ -> False
  6│              

with type

    Float

Output:

Test.alma [4:4]

Type mismatch:  Float  ≠  Bool

Expected

  2│  
  3│  test = when True is
  4│      1 | 2 | 3 -> True
   │      ↑
  5│      _ -> False
  6│              

with type

    Float

to have the same type as

  1│  module Test exposing (test)
  2│  
  3│  test = when True is
   │              ↑↑↑↑
  4│      1 | 2 | 3 -> True
  5│      _ -> False

with type

    Bool
